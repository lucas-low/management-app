Project and Task Management application with more intuitive UI/UX experience drag and drog with editable content per block of data.

Notable Features

- Utilizing Tree Data Structure for blocks of data between Project(s) and task(s)
- Create Project (parent)
- Create Task (child) that is linked to project(parent)
- Read the Parent and Children details at the same time
- Update the content immediately reflect its linked components i.e.: editing project name will change the sidebar project name
- Delete the project will also delete the associated tasks

Wholly overhauled upon v1 that was focusing only on full CRUD functionality on simplest UI with serverless MongoDB Atlas and Apollo-Client GraphQL on the backend.
